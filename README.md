## What is Chingu?

We're excited that you've chosen to join us and we know you have lots of 
questions. So let's get started! ðŸŽ¬

## Chingu Means Friend

It's important to know that "Chingu" means "friend" in Korean. This isn't just
catchy name, it's perfectly describes what we want this organization to be for
our members. 

We want to be that friend that supports your goal to advance in
your Web Development career. But, we also want every Chingu here to be just as
supportive.



The following topics address what we do, how you are expected to conduct yourself in our community, what to do first, and ways to get help when you need it.
