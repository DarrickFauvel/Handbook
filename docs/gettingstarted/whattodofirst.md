We use the information you provide to help us make your Chingu experience worthwhile, and we **NEVER** share your email address or other personal information.

Once you've submitted your Application you'll see that more Discord channels have become available to you. 
    

# 2. Create and submit your Solo Project

- [Choose the tier](https://www.notion.so/Solo-Projects-2a41ff900cc24a72a919f0eb5e79c42b?pvs=21) that matches your current skill level.
    
We have three tiers cooresponding to three levels of expertise - beginner (Tier 1), intermediate (Tier 2), & Experienced (Tier 3).
    
- [If you already have a project](https://www.notion.so/Solo-Projects-2a41ff900cc24a72a919f0eb5e79c42b?pvs=21) that matches your tier 
go ahead and submit it for evaluation. Your project can be one you've completed 
on your own or as a part of a team. It should meet this criteria:
    
- Coorespond to one of our three tiers
- It should be original work (not copied from someone else, including a tutorial)
- If created as part of a team you should be a major contributor to the project

If you don't have a project that matches your tier create one following the 
specifications we provide.

Submit a [Solo Project Completion form](https://docs.chingu.io/voyage/soloproj/submit) so we can evaluate your project.
    
One of our Facilitators will evaluate your Solo Project and will DM you in 
Discord with feedback you can use! They will look at both your code as well 
as the running app.

Once you've passed the Solo Project you'll be ready to participate in a Voyage!
