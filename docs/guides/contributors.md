## Tips

### Commits

If you are making a large change start by creating an issue in this repo to
define what you intend to do and assign it to **_Chingu Admins_**. One of our
Admins will review your proposal and provide feedback. This will make sure
you don't spend a lot of time and effort on a change that can't be
accepted. It might also lead to ideas that would make your idea even better.

For large changes make sure you create small atomic commits. Regardless of how
big a change is you should create [good commit messages](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/)
